# What is value of a pharmaceutical drug (continue...) 

- Value = .red[incremental] health outcomes gained per dollar spent 

- Value equation 

`$$value = \frac{\Delta Outcome}{\Delta Costs}$$`
&gt; If outcome is .red[Quality-Adjusted Life Years(QALYs)], the the value become .red[Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio] (ICER)

- Low value drugs are defined as those that provide little benefit

# Why is it important to measure the value

# Economic evaluation 

Definition: Drugs and other technologies are assessed for use and/or for a reimbursement price by looking at .red[incremental health-related effects] and .red[costs] relative to .red[existing treatments]. 

- Budget constraints

- Optimize available of resources 

  - Key concept 1: Marginal benefit equals to marginal cost
  
  - Key concept 2: The resources used for an individual would results in that the resource could not be used for others

# Global regulation on ecnomic evaluation

### Economic evaluation

.pull-left[

1. The United Kingdom: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)

  - Cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs)

1. Sweden: Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Board

  - Cost-effectiveness analysis for reimbursing drugs
  
1. Many other countries also establish specific agencies requesting economic evaluation for new medicines

1. United States: Less regulated. 

  - Forbids the use of cost per QALY as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost-effectiveness or recommended

# Health Technology Assessment 

.red[“Is the technology worth it?”]

What to assess: 

- Is the technology effective? What benefits does it bring?

- For whom does the technology work?

- What costs are entailed in its use?

- How does the technology compare with available treatment alternatives?

- Given the answers to these questions, is the technology worth using in the health care
system for some or all of those who would benefit?

---
# Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) 

### Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)

- Numerator: Difference between cost of new drugs and that of alternative under study

- Denominator: Difference of health outcomes (Effectiveness) of new drugs and alternative

`$$ICER = \frac{{Cost_{New Drug}}-Cost_{Status Quo}}{Effectiveness_{New Drug}-Effectiveness_{Status Quo}} = \frac{\Delta Cost}{\Delta Effectiveness}$$`

What is the meaning of ICER?

# Decision rule 

&lt;image src="libs/pic/Drules.png" width = "60%" &gt;

# Two key approaches for decision making 

- **Willingness to pay** (WTP)

Will you be willing to pay $100,000 to gain additional 1 years of your life with perfect health? 

- Comparing **ICER** to external reference standard or monetary threshold

Suppose the calculated ICER is $3,000 per QALY gained in Afghanistan for a vaccine program, is the vaccine program cost-effective?

# Quality-adjusted life **years** (QALYs)

.pull-left[
`$$QALY = Q*LYs$$` where Q is .red[Quality of Life] and LY is .red[Life **Years**]

`$$\Delta QALYs = Q_{n}*LYs_{n} - Q_{s}*LYs_{s}$$` where `n` means new drugs and `s` standard treatment

A typical TB patient with has an average quality of life of .red[0.8] during the
illness, and the TB symptoms last .red[6 months] until the patient is fully
recovered.

- How many QALYs does the patient live during the illness?

- How many QALYs saved per case if TB vaccine could avert the TB?

# Calcuation

`$$\Delta QALYs = Q_{n}*LYs_{n} - Q_{s}*LYs_{s}$$`
`$$Q_{n}*LYs_{n} = 1*\frac{6}{12}=1*0.5=0.5$$`

# An hypothetical example 


A dengue vaccine cost .red[$20] per dose. Full vaccination a child under 9 years old requires 3 doses. The efficiency of the dengue vaccine was estimated to be .red[60%]. The .red[QALYs loss] per dengue infection, on average was estimated to be .red[0.035]. 

The .red[incidence] of dengue in the country was estimated to be .red[2%] among children under 9. Assuming that the treatment cost per dengue case is, on average, .red[$200 per infection]. What is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the dengue vaccine. 
--

Based on this information, what would you recommend? 

### &lt;center&gt; [Poll](https://www.mentimeter.com/app/presentation/alxz84p1turvk4y3ayhceautkeqck39e/3dkxhvgj5auy)

&lt;/center&gt;

--

`$$\Delta Cost \text{ per person} = (20*3 + 100*0.02*0.4) - (0 + 100*0.02) = 58.8$$`
--

`$$\Delta QALY \text{ per person} = 2\%*0.035*0.6 = 0.00042$$`
--

`$$ICER = \frac{58.8}{0.00042} = 140,000$$`

What does this number tell us? Is it worthwhile to deploy the vaccine to control dengue?

# First Principles of Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Health

### Donald S. Shepard

### Mark S. Thompson
---
# Steps in cost-effectiveness analysis 

- .red[Define the program]

- Compute the net cost

- Compute net health effects

- Apply decision rules

- Perform sensitivity analysis
---
# Define the program 

- Develop alternative approaches to the problem

- Define precisely programs to be analyzed (who, what, where, when, and how)

  - Who: whose perspectives and whose outcomes 

    - societal, health system, government, payers 
    
  - What: what is the intervention
  
  - where: where the intervention is implemented 
  
  - When: time frame
  
  - How: How was the intervention implemented

---

# Compute net cost 

- Compute gross program costs

- Compute monetary savings

- Discount .red[future] costs and savings to present value (PV)

- Compute net costs (gross costs less savings
---

# Compute net health effects (in terms of additonal years of healthy life)

Add
- Additional years with full health

- Additional years of disease

- Improvement in health (no extension of life)

- Negative effects (inconveniences and morbidity)
---

# Apply decision rules 

- Identify case based on signs of net costs and net effects

- Apply rule for appropriate case

---

# Decision rules in cost-effectiveness 

&lt;img src="libs/pic/F12.1.png"&gt;

---

# Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis 

- Numerator: net use of health resources

- Denominator: net improvement in QALYs

 `$$ICER = \frac{\text{Net cost(in Monetary terms)}}{\text{Net health effect(in utility terms, e.g. QALY, DALYs)}}$$`
---

# Example of a cost-effectiveness ratio 

$$CE=\frac{US\$675,000}{10,410 \text{ DALYs gained}}$$

$$CE = \$65 \text{ per DALY gained}$$

.footnote[
1. Net health effects based on 347 toddler deaths averted, at 30 DALYs per death averted] 

---

# Perform sensitivity analysis 

- Vary uncertain parameters and recompute costs and health effects

- Examine effects on decision

---
# Calcuating the cost 

- What cost should be included

  - Intervention cost 
  
  - Potential savings from the intervention 
  
  - Costs assoicatied with the side effect of the cost

- Determine the cost perspective 

  - economics: include shadow cost and donoated costs
  
  - financial cost: does not include shadow and donated costs

---
### Type of cost and health service costs

.pull-left[

- Type of the cost 

  - Capital cost 
  
  - Recurrent cost
  ]
  
.pull-right[
# Health service costs 

- direct medical cost

- non-direct medical cost

- indirect cost
]
---
# Illusive cost example 

&lt;img src="libs/pic/f12.2.png"&gt;

---
# Discount future cost into present value 

### Present value 

  - The current value of a future sum of money given a  rate of return using the discount rate.
  
### Calculation of present value

- Future value, the money ($) you want in the future, for example $1000.
Interest rate (R) 0.03 or 3% ( be sure to check the format for the decimal or % of the rate). Number of periods (N), in this case 5 years

`\(FV = PV*(1+R)^n\)` `\(\longrightarrow\)` `\(PV=\frac{FV}{(1+R)^n}\)` 

PV = `\(\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^5}\)` = $862.61 

The money one needs to invest right now, in the present, at 3\% interest in order to get \$1000 in 5 years, is \$862.61. Similarly, if the program generates future benefits, the benefits will also be discounted.
